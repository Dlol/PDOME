# PDOME
Purr Data Open Modular Environment

## What is this?
This is a little passion project of mine because I love automatism, but it has no infrastructure for other people's modules (not even on patchstorage! :o) So I created this thing

## How do I submit a module?
Pull a request with your module, don't forget to provide info!
For credit, you can just put a comment somewhere in your patch

## How do I use it?
Open the ___MAIN.pd file in [purr data](https://github.com/agraef/purr-data/releases) and type the names of modules from here!
